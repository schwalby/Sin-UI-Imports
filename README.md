# Sin-UI-Imports
My own personal edit of the UI


[1] Make sure that you BACKUP your previous interface. You will need to copy the folders "Interface", and "WTF" contained in your World of Warcraft folder. Once you have your backup in a safe location, delete both WTF and Interface folders.

[2] After you backup your previous files extract the files of "Sin UI" to your World of Warcraft folder. 

[3] After you paste the folders, you must rename the folders contained in WTF ->, Account -> [ACCOUNTNAME], [SERVERNAME] and [CHARACTERNAME]. Be sure to check to make sure everything is correct!

[4] Once you have completed the renaming of the files, go to http://www.tukui.org/dl.php and download the latest version of "Elvui". Extract these files into your Interface->Addons folder. (This UI will NOT work if you skip this step!)

[5] In character selection make sure that you enable all the addons, and check off "Load out of date addons".

[6] Once you Login this is where it gets a bit tricky (bear with me, I'm working on getting a working installer. I'm not a proper coder by any means (if you are hit me up!)). 
 6.1- Select "ElvUI Chat" - This will disable the chat for Elvui.
 6.2- After the reload Skullflower's Installer will load. Do not click "Install", click "Finish". 
 6.3- Once the reload finishes, type /ec. This will open up the "ElvUI" ingame menu. 
 6.4- Go to "Profiles". Click on "Existing Profiles", then select the "Sin" profile. If you wish to have bars shown, please choose "Sin Exposed"
 6.5- Hit "esc", go to Interface-> Addons-> Prat. Select the "Sin" profile.
 6.6- Type /de options, go to profiles and select the "Sin" profile.
 6.7- Type /xct, go to profiles and select the "Sin" profile.
 6.8- Type /dbm, go to profiles and select the "Sin" profile.

[7] Well done! That was rough, but we persevered! Here, have a pretty UI for your efforts!




(Hopefully, fingers and toes crossed) - Through internal testing I've come across some issues with name and damage fonts configuring correctly (/ec -> Media -> Name/damage) and also Location Plus. Location Plus should fix itself if you go to /ec -> Select Location Plus-> Layout. If you check and uncheck backdrop it should display properly.

Special thanks to all who helped me test this, and to all of you who have downloaded it!
